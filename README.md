# Keyboard - PCB

This is a keyboard PCB designed to accomodate cherry mx switches. It is a 65% layout (no function key row)
I created this keyboard as i didnt have any good reliable portable keyboard that was comfortable to type on, so by making this i hope to solve that.
I will create this PCB hopefully using hackclub onboard, and then assemble it myself


## Features
- Atmega 32U4 microcontroller
- USB-C!
- Rotary encoder (with switch!!)

## TODO
- Add RGB backlighting!!
- Oled screen (SSD1306 0.91")
- A case?
